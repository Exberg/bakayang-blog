---

- I found the location at `lyon, france` and tried every possible attempts from the angle (street view) ... none of them works, I even tried changing different time.

---

- Then, after multiple attempts, I click at the `river` and open the `street view`.

---

- After `analyze and compare` the `image and street view`, I found out they are the same, the exact coords is at the `link url in red`.
