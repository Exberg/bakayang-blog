# BBCTF

This CTF was a challenging yet fun experience! Although I didnâ€™t manage to solve many challenges, I learned a lot along the way and gained insights into areas I need to improve. Hereâ€™s a brief summary of my experience.

## OSINT
I managed to solve one OSINT challenge during the event, but unfortunately, I forgot the exact details. ðŸ˜… From what I recall, it involved searching for specific information online and piecing together clues from various sources. It was a great reminder of how powerful open-source intelligence can be when solving real-world problems.

## Lessons Learned
- Time Management: I realized I need to allocate my time more effectively across challenges.
- Documentation: Keeping notes while solving challenges is crucial to avoid forgetting solutions later.
- Skill Gaps: I identified areas where I need to be only focused on -- web exploitation

## Moving Forward
While this CTF didnâ€™t go as planned, it highlighted areas I need to work on. Iâ€™ll be diving deeper into web exploitation and refining my approach to challenges. The goal isnâ€™t just to solve problems but to enjoy the process and learn something new each time.
